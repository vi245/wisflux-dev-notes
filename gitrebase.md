# git rebase
# why and when to use it?
The primary reason for rebasing is to maintain a linear project history. For example, consider a situation where the main branch has progressed since you started working on a feature branch.You want to get the latest updates to the main branch in your feature branch, but you want to keep your branch's history clean so it appears as if you've been working off the latest main branch. This gives the later benefit of a clean merge of your feature branch back into the main branch.
